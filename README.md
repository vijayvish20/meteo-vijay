# Being Weatherwise!

My name is Vijay Vishwakarma. I am an enthusiatic and motivated research scholar in the School of Earth Ocean and Climate Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Bhubaneshwar. I research evolves around Extreme Weather Events, Heavy Rainfall, Tropical Cyclones, and Meso-scale Convective Systems.

Here, I am starting with a vision to create editable and mangaeable programming codes to analyse Atmospheric Science datasets. I will feel fortunate enough if my codes will be of any help to others.

Cheers!
